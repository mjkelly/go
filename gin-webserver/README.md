# gin-webserver

This is a functionally equivalent version of 'webserver' (in a sister
directory), but using the gin web framework <https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin>.

It has more heavyweight dependencies, but the code in the main package is
shorter.

Run `glide install` (get glide from <https://glide.sh/> if you don't have it)
and then `go build .` to install and build.
